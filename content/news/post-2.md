There is HTML in this paragraph, and it is rendered. It appears to be **impossible** to render `.Summary` that is formatted in all cases.

It also appears to be impossible to render a .Summary and then show the remainder of the .Content afterwards if you want the content formatted in HTML. It appears to be possible to replace `.Summary` in `.Content` but only if you plainify `.Content` too, which means your output is going to be plainified, too.
